# WikiLinks
This program displays the shortest path from one Wikipedia article to the next one. It works by parsing the links of Wikipedia from the .sql file that can be downloaded as dump. With the parsed file the program can then display the shortest path between any two articles. Only tested on the German Wikipedia.
